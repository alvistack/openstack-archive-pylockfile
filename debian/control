Description: Platform-independent file locking module
 The lockfile module exports a FileLock class which provides a simple API
 for locking files. Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the Unix
 fcntl.flock, fcntl.lockf and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is
 identical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows
 platforms. The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link
 (on Unix) and mkdir (on Windows) system calls.
